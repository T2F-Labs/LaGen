}{ymphony represents} a paradigm shift that challenges the fundamental assumptions of how we build and interact with development environments. In an era where artificial intelligence is reshaping every aspect of technology, the tools we use to create software have remained surprisingly static, treating AI as an afterthought rather than a foundational element.
