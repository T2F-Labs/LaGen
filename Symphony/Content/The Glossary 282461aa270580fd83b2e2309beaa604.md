## A

**ACA (Access Control Architecture)**

A security framework for selective internal API access. Allows trusted sources (Microsoft, enterprise partners, vetted developers) to access internal APIs while maintaining security boundaries from untrusted community extensions. Enables dual library systems where enterprise and community extensions operate with different permission levels.

**ADD (Agent-Driven Development)**

A development paradigm where autonomous AI agents drive the software creation process while humans provide vision, guidance, and creative direction. Replaces the traditional model of developers writing every line of code manually. In ADD, you become a composer orchestrating intelligent systems rather than a coder writing every function.

**Addon (Motif)** 🧩

User-facing extensions that enhance Symphony's visual and interactive experience. Part of The Grand Stage (UFE) and External Assembling. Includes custom dashboards, specialized editors, developer tools, UI enhancements, and themes. Addons shape how developers visualize, debug, and interact with their projects. **Low policy focus** - primarily visual enhancements with minimal security concerns.

**AIDE (AI-First Development Environment)**

A new class of development system where AI agents are the primary actors, not supplementary tools. Unlike traditional IDEs that embed AI as features, an AIDE places intelligent orchestration at its core. Symphony is the first true AIDE, where AI doesn't just assist—it orchestrates the entire development lifecycle.

**Arbitration Engine** ⚖️

One of The Pit's five Rust-powered infrastructure extensions (Internal Assembling). Makes intelligent, fair decisions about resource allocation when multiple workflows compete for limited resources. Considers business value, user impact, cost efficiency, and learning value to resolve conflicts. Ensures equitable distribution while respecting priorities and constraints.

**Artifact**

Structured outputs produced by models and extensions throughout Symphony's workflow. Examples include JSON plans, configuration files, documentation, CSV backlogs, and code files. Artifacts form the communication layer between different components in the orchestration pipeline.

**Artifact Store** 💾

One of The Pit's five infrastructure extensions (Internal Assembling). Symphony's institutional memory that stores, versions, and manages every piece of data flowing through workflows. Tracks quality, relationships, and lineage of all artifacts. Provides intelligent retrieval with predictive preloading and maintains complete audit trails for compliance.

**Assembling**

The complete extension system architecture in Symphony, divided into Internal Assembling (The Pit - infrastructure extensions) and External Assembling (The Grand Stage - user-facing extensions). Represents the modular approach to building Symphony's capabilities through extensions rather than built-in features.

---

## B

**BiE (Built-in Extensions)**

Extensions that ship with Symphony's core installation. Includes essential functionality that every user needs immediately, like basic file operations, terminal integration, and fundamental UI components. Distinguished from community extensions which are installed separately.

Creates checkpoints and rollback strategies, identifies bottlenecks, and learns optimal execution patterns from historical data.

**DEA (Dual Ensemble Architecture)**

Symphony's architectural pattern of two distinct extension layers: The Pit (Infrastructure as Extensions / Internal Assembling) for performance-critical operations, and The Grand Stage (User-Faced Extensions / External Assembling) for creative functionality. Each layer uses different execution models optimized for their specific needs.

---

## E

**Editor Model** 👨‍💻

One of Symphony's seven orchestration models. Generates actual code files based on instructions from upstream models. Handles syntax, formatting, best practices, and produces production-ready source code. The final translation step from design to implementation.

**Enhancer-Prompt Model** 🎤

One of Symphony's seven orchestration models. The first model in the pipeline that enhances raw user prompts into detailed technical blueprints. Clarifies intent, adds technical context, and structures requirements for downstream models. Transforms vague ideas into actionable specifications.

**EPP (Execution Policy Playbook)**

One of the five kernel architecture patterns available for system design. Provides minimal kernel duties with raw resource allocation. Extensions communicate directly with each other and build their own abstractions. Offers ultimate performance and customization but requires more complex development. Perfect for research environments and experimental systems where maximum flexibility outweighs stability concerns.

**Extension**

A modular component that adds functionality to Symphony. Can be infrastructure (IaE in The Pit / Internal Assembling) or user-facing (UFE on The Grand Stage / External Assembling). Extensions communicate through the Orchestra Kit using either in-process calls (The Pit) or IPC (user extensions).

**Extension Categories**

Three types of user-facing extensions with different policy requirements:

- **🎻 Instruments**: AI/ML models (High policy focus - external dependencies, API calls, model hosting)
- **⚙️ Operators**: Utility functions (Medium policy focus - lightweight processing, data transformation)
- **🧩 Motifs (Addons)**: UI components (Low policy focus - visual enhancements, themes, dashboards)

**External Assembling**

The user-facing extension layer, also known as The Grand Stage (UFE). Where community developers build Instruments (AI models), Operators (utilities), and Addons/Motifs (UI enhancements). Extensions run out-of-process for safety and isolation. The creative, innovative layer where the community builds specialized functionality.

**External Ensemble**

Another term for External Assembling or The Grand Stage - the collection of community-driven extensions that run outside the core process.

Ensures strict boundary purity, adaptive flow control, and musical coherence across all orchestration layers.

---

## I

**IaE (Infrastructure as Extensions)**

The architectural philosophy where even core infrastructure runs as extensions. Embodied by The Pit's five Rust-powered components (Internal Assembling) that provide Symphony's foundation. These extensions use in-process execution for maximum performance.

**IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**

Traditional development tools (like VSCode, IntelliJ) built around human developers as central operators. Symphony transcends this with AIDE—where AI is central, not peripheral.

**IEC (Inter-Extension Communication)**

The safe, validated communication form that enables extensions different layers of communication within Symphony

**In-Process Execution**

The execution model used by The Pit (Internal Assembling) where extensions run within the same process as the Conductor. Enables microsecond-level performance through direct function calls and shared memory. Used for performance-critical infrastructure that requires nanosecond response times.

**Instrument** 🎻

AI/ML models integrated as extensions on The Grand Stage (External Assembling). Can be hosted models (GPT, Claude), local models, or custom fine-tuned models. Instruments bring intelligence to workflows and can be orchestrated by the Conductor in both Maestro Mode (automatic) and Manual Mode (user-controlled). **High policy focus** due to external dependencies, API calls, and model hosting requirements.

**Internal Assembling**

The infrastructure extension layer, also known as The Pit (IaE). Contains five privileged Rust-powered extensions: Pool Manager, DAG Tracker, Artifact Store, Arbitration Engine, and Stale Manager. These extensions run in-process with the Conductor for maximum performance and form Symphony's unshakable foundation.

One of Symphony's three operational modes. Ideal for full application creation from a single prompt. Uses complete orchestration with all seven models working together in a coordinated pipeline. The Conductor automatically selects and blends AI models for optimal results, making all configuration and execution decisions based on learned patterns and user context. Best for starting new projects from scratch.

**Manifest**

Every extension's contract with Symphony. A TOML file that declares what the extension does, what permissions it needs, what capabilities it provides, and how it should be executed. The Orchestra Kit uses manifests to generate configuration UIs, manage dependencies, and enforce security.

**Manual Mode**

An orchestration mode where users have complete control over model selection, configuration, and execution. For developers who want explicit control over which models run and how.

**MCCF (Model Criticality Classification Framework)**

A system that automatically classifies models as Essential, Recommended, or Optional through balanced objective analysis. Combines practical pattern matching with adaptive weighted scoring to determine model importance in workflows. Uses transparent reasoning that balances automation with human understanding. Helps Symphony make intelligent decisions about which models are truly necessary for a given task.

**Melody**

A user-created or Conductor-generated workflow in Symphony—a visual, composable sequence of extensions from the Orchestra Kit, orchestrated to automate development tasks. Melodies can be manually composed by the user or automatically generated by the Conductor Model based on user requirements (typically introduced as a prompt from the user to the Conductor in chat). Each Melody is composed on the Harmony Board as a “musical score,” where nodes (Instruments, Operators, Addons) are connected, initiated by triggers (manual or scheduled), and configured for behavior (parameters, error handling). The Conductor manages execution, routes events, dispatches tasks, and handles errors (retry, fallback, skip). Extensions produce artifacts (inputs, intermediates, outputs, metadata) for auditing and flow chaining.

**Microkernel Architecture**

Symphony's chosen kernel architecture pattern. Features an ultra-minimal core (Conductor) with maximum modularity—all other components run as extensions in user space. Provides exceptional reliability through isolated failures, easy maintenance with hot-swappable components, ultimate flexibility for customization, and clear debugging with independent component testing. The foundation that enables Symphony's extension-first philosophy.

**Minimal IDE**

Symphony's philosophy of shipping only essential features in the core (text editor, file tree, syntax highlighting, settings, terminal, extension system) while everything else comes from community extensions. Results in fast startup, zero bloat, and infinite customization.

**Monolithic Kernel Architecture**

One of the five kernel architecture patterns available for system design. All critical components run in kernel space with direct function calls for maximum performance. Offers straightforward design and simplified debugging but creates a single failure domain with rigid structure. Best for high-performance scenarios where maximum speed is critical and stability risks are acceptable.

**Motif** 🧩

Another name for Addon—visual and experiential extensions on The Grand Stage (External Assembling). Named to fit Symphony's musical metaphor. Includes UI components, themes, custom editors, and enhanced user experiences. **Low policy focus** - primarily concerned with visual presentation and user interaction rather than security or external dependencies.

---

## N

**Nanokernel Architecture**

**Orchestra Kit**

The complete framework that assembles, orchestrates, and safeguards Symphony's extension ecosystem. Includes sandboxed execution, dependency management, auto-generated configuration UIs, the marketplace, and the communication protocols between all components. Not just a marketplace—it's the entire performance system.

**Orchestration**

The intelligent coordination of AI agents, models, and tools to accomplish development tasks. Symphony's core capability—the Conductor orchestrates specialized agents to work together like musicians in a symphony.

**Out-of-Process Execution**

The execution model used by The Grand Stage extensions (External Assembling) where each extension runs in an isolated process. Provides crash protection, memory isolation, and independent update cycles. Communication happens through IPC Bus with 0.1-0.5ms latency—acceptable for user-facing features.
