# Vibe Coding

> Challenges and Problems
> 

### 🧠 Introduction

"Vibe coding," a term introduced by AI researcher Andrej Karpathy in early 2025, refers to the practice of generating code using natural language prompts with large language models (LLMs). Tools like Cursor's Chat, GitHub Copilot, and Claude have popularized this style, enabling conversational and iterative development. While it allows rapid prototyping and accessibility for non-technical users, vibe coding also introduces significant risks. This analysis highlights key challenges, potential disasters, and personal impacts of relying solely on this approach.

### ✅ Conclusion

Vibe coding offers rapid innovation for prototyping and creative exploration. However, it comes with serious limitations: code quality issues, security risks, high maintenance burdens, and the danger of skill stagnation. As real incidents have shown, deploying vibe-coded applications without proper safeguards can lead to data breaches and project failure.

**To use vibe coding responsibly:**

- Combine it with fundamental coding knowledge.
- Conduct rigorous testing.
- Apply security and operational best practices.
