## Common Misconceptions

### "Verification guarantees perfect security"

**Reality:** Verification indicates higher trust levels but doesn't eliminate all risks. Users should still exercise judgment and follow security best practices.

### "Only large companies can get verified"

**Reality:** Community verification is specifically designed for individual developers and small teams. Quality and community impact matter more than company size.

### "Verification is permanent once achieved"

**Reality:** All verification types are subject to ongoing evaluation. Poor maintenance, security issues, or community feedback can result in verification removal.

### "Non-verified extensions are unsafe"

**Reality:** Many excellent extensions exist without verification badges. Verification is one factor among many when evaluating extension quality.

## Getting Started

1. **Assess your current position:** Evaluate which verification path aligns with your situation and goals
2. **Set realistic timeline:** Community verification typically takes 6-12 months of sustained effort
3. **Focus on fundamentals:** Prioritize extension quality, documentation, and user experience
4. **Engage authentically:** Build genuine relationships within the developer community
5. **Monitor progress:** Track your extension metrics and community feedback regularly
6. **Stay persistent:** Trust building takes time - maintain consistent quality and engagement
