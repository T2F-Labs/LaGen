# Learn MLOps

### Top Free Professional MLOps Courses and Tutorials

Based on an extensive search across web sources, GitHub, YouTube, and educational platforms, I've compiled the best **full, professional-grade** free resources for learning MLOps (Machine Learning Operations). These focus on productionizing ML workflows, covering experiment tracking, deployment, CI/CD, monitoring, and scaling. I prioritized comprehensive, hands-on courses (e.g., 9+ weeks or 10+ hours) suitable for data scientists, ML engineers, and DevOps pros. All are legally free—no payment required for core content.

Coursera and Udacity offer "audit" modes for many courses, allowing free access to videos, readings, and quizzes (certificates may cost extra). YouTube and GitHub options are fully open-access. For brevity, I've tabled the top 5, with summaries, structures, and access links. These are current as of November 2025.

| **MLOps Tutorial 2025** | AlmaBetter (web-based) | Self-paced (7 modules, 27 lessons; ~10-15 hrs est.) | - Module 1: Intro/challenges/principles.<br>- Module 2: Git/GitHub, branching, Git LFS for artifacts.<br>- Module 3: Docker (images, cloud runs, ML best practices).<br>- Module 4: CI/CD (Jenkins pipelines, testing, Kubernetes deploy).<br>- Module 5: Monitoring/logging (metrics, alerts, visualization).<br>- Module 6: Scaling (Spark distributed, Docker Swarm vs. K8s).<br>- Module 7: Ethics (bias, privacy, guidelines).<br>Quizzes, certificate on completion. | Basic programming/ML. | Covers ethics/scaling often overlooked; tool-deep (Spark/K8s); 4.5k+ learners. | [AlmaBetter Site](https://www.almabetter.com/bytes/tutorials/mlops) |
| **MLOps | Machine Learning Operations Specialization** | Coursera (Duke University) | 4 courses (~3 months, 5 hrs/week; audit mode) | - Course 1: MLOps foundations (lifecycle, tools).<br>- Course 2: Data pipelines (ETL, versioning).<br>- Course 3: Model deployment (APIs, containers).<br>- Course 4: Monitoring/iteration (drift, A/B testing).<br>Projects: Build scalable ML systems. | Python, ML basics. | Academic rigor + capstone; audit free (pay ~$49/mo for cert); aligns with Google/Amazon practices. | [Coursera Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mlops-machine-learning-duke) |

### Additional Free Audit Options

- **Coursera**: Audit "Machine Learning Engineering for Production (MLOps)" by [DeepLearning.AI](http://deeplearning.ai/) (free videos/quizzes; 4 weeks). Or Andrew Ng's ML Specialization (broader but MLOps-adjacent).
- **Udacity**: Free "Intro to Machine Learning" (leads into MLOps); full Nanodegrees like ML DevOps Engineer are paid (~$399/mo), but audit previews available.
- **Google Cloud Skills Boost**: "Machine Learning Operations (MLOps): Getting Started" (free, 2-3 hrs; labs on Vertex AI).

These resources emphasize hands-on practice (e.g., deploying models to AWS/K8s) over theory, mirroring enterprise workflows. Start with Zoomcamp for depth or the YouTube marathons for quick immersion. Communities like Reddit's r/mlops recommend Zoomcamp as the "gold standard" for job-ready skills.

### On Pirated/Illegal Platforms

Searches for torrents/downloads mostly surfaced legal freebies, but sites like [Downloadlynet.ir](http://downloadlynet.ir/) and [HacksNation.com](http://hacksnation.com/) offer unauthorized rips of paid courses (e.g., Coursera's MLOps Specialization or Krish Naik's Udemy bootcamps on ML/NLP/MLOps). These violate copyrights and platform terms, risking malware/legal issues—**I strongly advise against them**. Instead, use free audits or the open resources above; they're equally professional and ethical. If you need paid certs, platforms like Udemy often have $10 sales.
