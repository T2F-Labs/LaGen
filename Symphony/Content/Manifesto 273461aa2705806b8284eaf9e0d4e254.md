# Manifesto

## Our Mission

We are building Symphony IDE - the first true AI-First Development Environment. We're not just creating software; we're composing the future of human-AI collaboration in development.

## Core Values

### 🎼 Harmony Through Respect

Just as Symphony orchestrates intelligent agents in perfect harmony, we orchestrate our team through mutual respect. Every team member is a valued musician in our company symphony.

**This means:**

- We respond to each other professionally
- We honor our commitments and respect each other's time

- We communicate challenges early rather than missing deadlines
- We show our progress regularly, even when work is incomplete
