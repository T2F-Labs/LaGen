# Traits

## Overview

In Symphony IDE, each agentic model plays a distinct role in the orchestration of software development from a single prompt. These roles follow a structured flow and are best represented through unique cognitive and operational traits. This document defines the traits of each model in the **operational flow order** to guide implementation and model selection.

## 1. 🎼 Feature Model — *The Project Manager*

**Primary Traits:**

- **Execution-Oriented**: Tracks delivery progress and ensures tasks are implemented as specified.
- **Backlog Custodian**: Maintains EPICs, user stories, and ensures coverage of the entire feature set.
- **Process-Driven**: Knows methodologies (Agile, Kanban) and ensures the team follows the correct cadence.
- **Status Awareness**: Monitors and reports on project progress.

> Ideal Model Behavior: Task-tracker model with backlog synchronization, goal-checking logic, and integration with planning timelines.

## 2. 🏗️ Planner Model — *The Strategist*

**Primary Traits:**

- **Multi-Disciplinary Knowledge**: Synthesizes domain expertise, project patterns, and technical solutions.
- **Problem Solver**: Anticipates risks, proposes strategies, and breaks down abstract goals into tasks.
- **Leadership-Aware**: Understands capacities and constraints, balancing ambition with feasibility.
- **High-Level Abstraction**: Outputs structured architecture and design guidance.

> Ideal Model Behavior: Long-context reasoning agent, able to analyze, prioritize, and synthesize structured output (plans, architecture, task graphs).

## 3. 🕹️ Coordinator Model — *The Executor & Enforcer*

**Primary Traits:**

- **Instruction-Focused**: Converts high-level plans into detailed execution flows.
- **Operational Memory**: Maintains awareness of current state of tasks, delegations, and pending actions.
- **Task Dispatcher**: Allocates and sequences duties among agents (e.g., Editor, Visualizer).
- **Synchronization Agent**: Ensures all models are in sync across state and timing.
- **Reactive Logic**: Adjusts instructions dynamically based on feedback from downstream models.

> Ideal Model Behavior: Finite-state orchestrator with reactive feedback handling and dynamic scheduling capabilities.

## 4. 🧮 Visualizer Model — *The Imaginative Thinker*

**Primary Traits:**

- **Abstract Visualization**: Translates system states into diagrams, mental models, or code maps.
- **State Integrity**: Requires consistent full-state context to produce meaningful outputs.
- **Balanced Cadence**: Operates in sync—not too fast or too slow.
- **Creative Framing**: Needs imaginative capabilities to model unseen or ideal states.

> Ideal Model Behavior: Hybrid symbolic-visual model with strong semantic understanding and embedding-based spatial mapping.
>

## 5. 🧑‍💻 Editor Model — *The Craftsman*

**Primary Traits:**

- **Detail-Oriented**: Understands how every function, variable, and type fits into the whole.
- **Persistent Worker**: Handles tasks from start to finish without shortcuts.
- **Low-Level Mastery**: Operates on syntax, semantics, dependencies, and file structures.
- **Slow and Precise**: Optimized for accuracy, not speed.

> Ideal Model Behavior: Deterministic code generator with long attention span, static analysis hooks, and high fidelity to logic.

## Summary Table (Flow Order)

| Flow Order | Model | Key Traits | Primary Focus | Ideal Characteristics |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Feature | Task-driven, process-aware, structured | Backlog and progress tracking | Checklist enforcer, milestone-aware |
| 2 | Planner | Strategic, problem-solving, high-abstraction | Project planning & task design | Long-context reasoning, structured output |
| 3 | Coordinator | Reactive, instruction-focused, sync-keeper | Task scheduling & dispatch | FSM-like orchestrator, task graph execution |
| 5 | Visualizer | Creative, balanced, full-state contextual | Visualization & architecture | Diagram synthesis, abstract spatial logic |
| 6 | Editor | Detailed, slow, full-construction | Code generation & refinement | Precise code writing with structural awareness |

## Final Note

*Each model plays a vital role in Symphony's orchestration flow. Choosing or designing models that align with these traits ensures harmony in execution and scalability of orchestration.*
