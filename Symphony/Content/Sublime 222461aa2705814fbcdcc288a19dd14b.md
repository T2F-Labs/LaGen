# Sublime

Below is a comprehensive list of Sublime Text features, covering documented, undocumented, user-facing, developer-oriented, and hidden capabilities, as derived from official documentation, community resources, and forums.

- **Multi-line Editing**: Enables simultaneous editing across multiple lines using multiple cursors. Use `Ctrl+D` (Windows/Linux) or `⌘+D` (Mac) to select word occurrences, `Ctrl+Shift+L` (Windows/Linux) or `⇧+⌘+L` (Mac) to split selections into lines, or `Ctrl+Alt+Up/Down` (Windows/Linux) or `⌃+⇧+Up/Down` (Mac) to add cursors. `Alt+F3` (Windows/Linux) or `⌃+⌘+G` (Mac) selects all occurrences, and `Ctrl+U` (Windows/Linux) or `⌘+U` (Mac) undoes selections.
- **Build Systems**: Allows running external programs like compilers or interpreters via `.sublime-build` JSON files. Triggered with `Ctrl+B` (Windows/Linux) or `⌘+B` (Mac), with output in the console. Customizable via `Tools > Build System > New Build System` and supports file-type-specific configurations.
- **Search and Replace**: Supports regex-based search and replace across files, projects, or folders via `Find > Find in Files`. Incremental find (`Ctrl+I` or `⌘+I`) navigates results quickly. Ideal for complex text manipulations like stripping HTML tags.
- **Snippets**: Reusable code templates inserted via trigger words and tab. Custom snippets created via `Tools > Developer > New Snippet`, supporting placeholders (`$1`, `$2`) for dynamic content.
- **Projects and Workspaces**: Groups files and settings in `.sublime-project` files, with session data in `.sublime-workspace` files. Managed via `Project > Edit Project`, allowing file exclusions and custom build systems.
- **Themes and Color Schemes**: Customizes UI (themes) and syntax highlighting (color schemes). Includes defaults like Adaptive and supports packages like Material Theme. Adjustable via JSON settings.
- **Settings**: Configurable via JSON in global (`Preferences.sublime-settings`), project-specific, or syntax-specific files. Common options include `font_size`, `tab_size`, and `word_wrap`. Edited via `Preferences > Settings`.
- **Command Palette**: Searchable interface (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `⌘+Shift+P`) for executing commands, including those from plugins. Uses adaptive matching to prioritize frequent commands.
- **Minimap**: Displays a scaled-down file view for navigation by clicking or dragging. Highlights the visible region.
- **Sidebar**: Manages project files with drag-and-drop and context menu actions. Enhanced by plugins like SideBarEnhancements.
- **Tabs and Status Bar**: Toggleable UI elements via commands like `View: Toggle Tabs` or settings like `show_status_bar`. Tabs support multiple open files, and the status bar shows file info.
- **Package Control**: Package manager for installing and managing plugins via `Package Control: Install Package Control: Install Package`. Supports automatic updates and custom channels.
- **SideBarEnhancements**: Plugin enhancing package sidebar with actions like moving files to trash or copying paths.
- **SublimeREPL**: Runs Plugin interpreters for running languages like Python or Ruby within Sublime Text.
- **Material Theme**: Customizable, visually appealing plugin for UI styling.
- **Emmet**: Accelerates Plugin HTML/CSS coding with abbreviations for faster web development.

- **Plugin API**: Python-based API for manipulating views, windows, selections, and more. Supports thread-safe operations and JSON-compatible parameters.
- **Event Listeners**: Allows plugins to respond to events like `on_load`, `on_pre_save`, `on_post_save`, `on_modified`, and `on_selection_modified` via `sublime_plugin.EventListener`.
- **Commands**: Underpins keybindings, menus, and macros. Includes commands like `clone_file`, `detect_indentation`, `fold_by_level`, and `insert_best_completion`. Accessible via the command palette.
- **Custom Completions**: Undocumented API method `EventListener.on_query_completions` supports custom completion lists with descriptions using `\t` in triggers.
- **Timed Functions**: Undocumented API method `sublime_plugin.run_timed_function` schedules timed tasks for threading.
- **Heart Easter Egg**: In Sublime Text 2, typing certain characters with the heart symbol (❤) displays it in red, e.g., `I ♥❤ opensourcehacker.com`.
- **Draw White Space**: Setting `"draw_white_space": "all"` displays invisible characters like spaces and tabs for debugging.
- **Toggle Menu**: Command `View: Toggle Menu` restores the menu bar if hidden.
- **Cancel Build**: Command `Build: Cancel` stops running builds.
- **GPU Rendering**: Experimental feature in Sublime Text 4 for improved performance in rendering UI elements.
