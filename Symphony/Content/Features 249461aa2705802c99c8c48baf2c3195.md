# Features

A comprehensive list of Visual Studio Code’s features, covering its core functionality, integrated tooling, extensibility model, and experimental capabilities.

- **Multi-Process Architecture**: Ensures stability by running the UI, extensions, and main application in separate processes. Prevents a crashed extension from taking down the entire editor.
- **Multi-Cursor Editing**: Edit in multiple places at once. Use `Alt+Click` to add cursors, `Ctrl+D` (Windows/Linux) or `⌘+D` (Mac) to select next occurrences, and `Ctrl+Shift+L` (`⇧+⌘+L`) to split a selection into lines.
- **Command Palette**: Access all commands via a searchable interface with `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `⌘+⇧+P` (Mac).
- **Quick Open**: Quickly find and open files by name using `Ctrl+P` (Windows/Linux) or `⌘+P` (Mac).
- **IntelliSense**: Umbrella term for smart code completion, parameter info, quick info, and member lists, powered by language services.
- **Integrated Debugger**: A language-agnostic debugging UI for setting breakpoints, stepping through code, and inspecting variables. Configured via `launch.json` and powered by the Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP).
- **Integrated Terminal**: A full-featured command-line terminal integrated into the editor. Open with `Ctrl+`` (Windows/Linux) or `⌃+`` (Mac). Supports multiple instances and shell profiles.
- **Source Control (Git) Integration**: Built-in support for Git. Manage changes, stage files, commit, push, and pull directly from the Source Control view (`Ctrl+Shift+G` or `⌃+⇧+G`).
- **Peek Definition**: View and edit a function’s definition in an inline window without leaving your current code, using `Alt+F12` (Windows/Linux) or `⌥+F12` (Mac).
- **Snippets**: Reusable code templates inserted via trigger words. Create custom snippets via `Configure User Snippets`, with support for tab stops and placeholders.
- **Profiles**: Create and switch between different collections of settings, extensions, keybindings, and UI layouts for various development tasks or projects.
- **Settings System**: Highly customizable configuration via a UI or directly in JSON files (`settings.json`). Supports user (global), workspace (project-specific), and folder-level scopes.
- **Multi-root Workspaces**: Open and manage multiple project folders within a single VS Code window, ideal for monorepos or related projects.
- **Preview Mode**: Single-clicking a file in the explorer opens it in a temporary “preview” tab. The tab becomes permanent upon editing. Can be disabled with the `workbench.editor.enablePreview` setting.
- **Timeline View**: See a chronological history of a file, including both Git commits and local saves, allowing for easy comparison and restoration of previous versions.
- **Language Server Protocol (LSP)**: A protocol that allows language-specific analysis (like linting, autocompletion) to run in a separate process, enabling rich language support for any LSP-compliant language.
- **Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP)**: A protocol that standardizes the communication between the editor’s debugger UI and a language-specific debugger, enabling multi-language debugging support.
- **Extension Marketplace**: A vast ecosystem of community and first-party extensions that add new languages, themes, debuggers, and tools.
- **Activation Events**: A performance feature that lazy-loads extensions only when they are needed (e.g., when a specific file type is opened), ensuring a fast startup time.
- **Contribution Points**: A declarative system in an extension’s `package.json` that allows it to add UI elements like commands, menus, and views in a safe and consistent way.
- **Webview API**: An API for extensions to create fully custom user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript inside an editor panel.
- **Testing API**: Provides a unified Test Explorer view where extensions can contribute tests from various frameworks, allowing users to run and debug tests from a single interface.
- **Settings Sync**: Synchronizes settings, extensions, profiles, and UI state across different machines using a GitHub or Microsoft account.
- **GitHub Copilot**: An AI-powered assistant for code completion and chat. The chat view (`#file`, `#selection`) provides contextual code generation, explanation, and refactoring.
- **Agent Mode**: An experimental, autonomous AI paradigm where Copilot can formulate and execute multi-step plans to accomplish high-level tasks, such as creating new features or fixing bugs.
- **`vscode.lm` API**: An API that allows any extension to access the large language models (LLMs) available in VS Code to build its own AI-powered features.
- **Insiders Build**: A daily-updated version of VS Code for testing new and experimental features. Can be installed side-by-side with the stable version.
- **Proposed APIs**: A system of unstable, internal APIs used for experimentation. “Blessed” extensions, primarily from Microsoft, can use these APIs in the public marketplace, granting them access to capabilities unavailable to others.
- **Conditional File Exclusion**: An advanced setting (`files.exclude` with a `when` clause) to hide files from the explorer based on context (e.g., hide `.js` files when a corresponding `.ts` file exists).
- **Developer Commands**: A suite of internal commands (`Developer: ...`) for extension development and inspecting the editor’s internal state, such as `Developer: Inspect Context Keys`.
- **Shell Command Installation**: A one-time setup command (`Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH`) that makes the `code` executable available system-wide from any external terminal
