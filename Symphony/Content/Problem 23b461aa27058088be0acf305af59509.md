# Problem

## 📜 Challenge Description

John is thirsty and wants to drink milk from the fridge.

Your mission is to write a Python script using the provided functions to complete this task.

The level has multiple possible paths to solve it. Your solution will be scored based on:

- correctness (must return `'Delicious!'`),
- completeness (using optional but safe functions),
- and efficiency (avoiding redundant actions).

Some functions are **optional**, like `check_freshness()` or `look_inside_fridge()`, but using them adds quality and increases your **score**.

Also note: A single level can include **multiple challenges**, and each challenge can be solved in multiple ways.

## 🧰 Provided Functions

All functions are predefined and behave as described.

| Function | Description | Optional | Score Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `open_fridge()` | Opens the fridge so John can interact with its contents | ❌ | Required (0) |
| `look_inside_fridge()` | Lets John inspect the contents before grabbing anything | ✅ | +10 |
| `grab_item(item_name)` | Picks an item (e.g.,`"milk"`) from the fridge | ❌ | Required (0) |
| `check_freshness(item_name)` | Checks if the milk is fresh | ✅ | +20 |
| `wash_glass()` | Cleans the glass before use | ✅ | +10 |
| `pour_into_glass(item_name)` | Pours the milk into a clean glass | ❌ | Required (0) |
| `drink_from_glass()` | Makes John drink and return`'Delicious!'` | ❌ | +100 (goal) |
| `inventory()` | Lists what John currently has (glass, milk, etc.) | ✅ | +5 |

---

## 🧪 Objective

Create **a valid script** that ends with:

<aside>
ℹ️ DELICIOUS!

</aside>

Then, explore **multiple possible paths** and assign a **score** to each based on their safety and efficiency.

## 🧮 Scoring Criteria

| Quality Factor | Description | Score Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ Goal Achieved | Ends with `drink_from_glass()` returning `'Delicious!'` | +100 |
| 🧠 Uses `check_freshness()` | Ensures safety of milk | +20 |
| 👀 Uses `look_inside_fridge()` | Increases confidence about item existence | +10 |
| 🧼 Uses `wash_glass()` | Ensures clean glass | +10 |
| 🧾 Uses `inventory()` | Optional introspection, low impact | +5 |
| 📉 Redundant or unnecessary steps | Decreases score (clutter, inefficiency) | −5 each |

Now, the challenge is ready to be solved by listing all possible solution paths and assigning scores to them accordingly.
